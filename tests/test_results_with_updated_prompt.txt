For test case:

  - input: What is Chick-fil-A's policy on arbitration?
  - actual output: Chick-fil-A's policy on arbitration involves resolving disputes through either arbitration or small claims court if a claim cannot be settled within 60 days. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Resolution Timeframe**: If your claim isn't resolved within 60 days, you can start arbitration or go to small claims court.

2. **Starting Arbitration**: To begin arbitration, you need to send a letter describing your claim to Chick-fil-A's Legal Department and the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

3. **Choice of Court**: If your claim could be handled in small claims court, you or Chick-fil-A can choose to have it heard there instead of arbitration, as long as you notify the other party in writing before an arbitrator is appointed.

4. **Dispute Resolution**: If there's a disagreement about whether a claim should go to small claims court, that court will decide, not an arbitrator. The arbitration process will pause until the small claims court makes a decision.
